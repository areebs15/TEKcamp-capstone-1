What are you asked to find or show?

I am being asked to create an inventory management system by using react. This means that i need to choose a topic/business
to create a web display of there products. The site needs to show available items, allow a purchase feature (shopping cart).
and also a product description page. This will be layed out similar to any other online ecommerce site. There will be a conglomerate page of all items with short descriptions showing what it is, its price, and any other necessary descriptors. the.
The shopping cart page will display items selected by a user along with there descriptions. Inventory elements should update based on what the user does from that point.
The product display page will show individual items based on the users click. If a user wants to know more about any individual product, they can click the "more info button" to be redirected.
